### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Christian Lurhakwa, people call me Scott for some reasons. I am a software engineer with 7+ years of experience.
I have worked on lots of projects, in different sectors and made huge impacts through my contributions.
I do a a lot bit of everything: front end, back end, mobile, systems, database administration and management because I like to be there whenever something is needed and I want to be helpful.
